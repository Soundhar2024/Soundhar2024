👋 Hi, I’m @Soundhar2024

👀 I’m interested in full-stack development, cloud computing, building scalable web applications, and hybrid native mobile applications. I love exploring new technologies and enhancing my coding skills.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced React patterns, TypeScript, and serverless architecture to build more efficient and maintainable applications.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, especially those related to web development frameworks, cloud-native applications, and innovative tools that solve real-world problems.
